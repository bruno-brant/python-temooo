    "[Termo](http://term.ooo), uma versão tupi-guarani do [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), é um jogo de advinhação que tem como objetivo encontrar uma \"palavra secreta\". De início, sabemos apenas que ela faz parte da lingua portuguesa (pt-BR) e que tem cinco letras, o que nos dá uma gama enorme de possibilidades (_em nosso léxico, mais de 3000 palavras_). Temos seis \"chutes\" para conseguir acertar a palavra e, a cada chute, recebemos pistas: o jogo nos dirá, para cada letra, se acertamos (_a palavra tem aquela letra naquela posição_) se quase acertamos (_a palavra tem aquela letra, mas não naquela posição_), ou se erramos (_a palavra não tem aquela letra_).\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitivamente, segue-se um processo de eliminação para deduzir qual é a palavra. As primeiras tentativas servem para ter um número mínimo de pistas (letras) e, a partir daí, fazemos um esforço mental para lembrar de alguma palavra que obedeça as **restrições** impostas pelo jogo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Para resolver esse jogo de forma algoritimica, vamos emular o que um ser humano faria, mas de forma mais exata e precisa; como não contamos com a intuição, teremos que usar outras capacidades que o computador nos trás."

    "Ao longo deste notebook vamos descrever uma abordagem para encontrar a palavra no menor número de chutes possíveis. Idealmente, queremos um algoritmo que, na média, seja mais eficiente que um ser humano. \n",
    "\n",
    "Para iniciar, utilizaremos um léxico com as palavras que entendemos serem possíveis. O autor do jogo publicou o léxico utilizado pelo próprio Termo, mas vamos utilizar uma fonte diferente, para provar que o algoritmo é eficiente (usar o léxico do jogo reduz o espaço de busca e torna mais fácil encontrar a palavra).\n",
    "\n",
    "Daí em diante, vamos utilizar uma abordagem estatística para encontrar a melhor palavra. O que queremos é reduzir o espaço de busca para apenas 1 palavra no menor número de chutes possíveis, então vamos precisar do seguinte:\n",

    "* Determinar quão bom é um chute.\n",
    "* Filtrar o léxico (*espaço de busca*) com base nas pistas que já temos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Não é a proposta aqui de desenvolver um programa que _jogue_ o jogo. Isso poderia ser feito, por exemplo, através de um scriptlet (quem sabe meu próximo projeto?). Por enquanto, só queremos achar uma abordagem que tenha um bom desempenho. Para isso, um notebook Jupyter é ótimo."
